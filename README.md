# IS1220 Project - Simulation of a bicycle sharing system

This school project was about simulating a bicycle system, like the velib' system in Paris. The principal objects of our implementation was Stations, Users and bikes. The hardest part of the project was to implement relations between User and Station, as well as the Ride planification that was suggesting to the users itineraries based on various optimisation fonctions.
